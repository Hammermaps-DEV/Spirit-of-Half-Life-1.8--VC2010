Note:
I'm no modeller.

The models w_camera.mdl, w_portablemed.mdl (and w_portablemedt.mdl)
are place holders only. The 'camera' model is the rpg rocket and the medkit model is the same as the standard medkit.

Until newer models are created to replace these, they'll have to do.

Feel free to create your own models, and if they're cool enough you might be able to get them included in an updated release.


Confused (a.k.a Mr programmer dude) <- note the capital 'M'
